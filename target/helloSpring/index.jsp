<h1>BJCP API</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
	This is personal project that provides an API from the new 2015 BJCP styles. BJCP API will provide some logic in order to 'search' by different attributes inside every style.
</p>
<p>
	Such features will provide a powerful base for different applications. Imagine, for example, a recommended system of which styles could you prefer.
</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>
	Information you could retrieve, runs over info scraped by this github project: https://github.com/gthmb/bjcp-2015-json
</p>

<h2>Future / TODO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Work over more 'search' features</li>
  <li>XML support</li>
  <li>Clean index page (based on Markdown)</li>
  <li>2008 BJCP style guidelines support</li>
  <li>Shown scraped translations from bjcp.org page</li>
</ul>
